# 1.0 Install/Uninstall

The ModuleAdmin Framework is part of XOOPS Core since XOOPS 2.5.4, so currently there is no need to install it separately.

For a module to take advantage of the ModuleAdmin Framework, you only have to set "system_mune" to "1" in the xoops_version.php:

```$modversion['system_menu'] = 1;```
