```$modversion['system_menu'] = 1; ```

This instruction automatically enables a navigation menu inside the administration area of the module :

The upper part is automatically generated and tabs are created by the ```menu.php``` file located in: 

    modulename 
        L admin 
            L menu.php. 

The menu.php file must have the following structure: 

```php
$adminmenu[1]['title'] = _MI_MODULENAME_INDEX; $adminmenu[1]['link'] = "admin/index.php";
$adminmenu[1]['icon'] = "images/admin/home.png"; 
$adminmenu[2]['title'] =_MI_MODULENAME_FIRSTMENU; 
$adminmenu[2]['link'] = "admin/firstmenu.php"; 
$adminmenu[2]['icon'] = "images/admin/firstmenu.png"; 
$adminmenu[3]['title'] = _MI_MODULENAME_ABOUT; 
$adminmenu[3]['link'] = "admin/about.php"; 
$adminmenu[3]['icon'] = "images/admin/about.png"; ```

```$adminmenu[id]['title'] ```

Variable in which you indicate the title of the link. 

```$adminmenu[id]['link'] ```

Variable in which you specify the link path 

```$adminmenu[id]['icon'] ```
