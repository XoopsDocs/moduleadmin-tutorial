# 5.0 The help section of the module



To create a help section we added in xoops_version.php : 
$modversion['help'] = 'page=help'; 
This instruction automatically enables a help button in the navigation tab of the module's administration : 
 
Also,It enables to create a menu in the admin index page : 
 
The help template exists is in the language file so it can be translated for each language. The structure is as follows : 
modulename + language + english + help +help.html 
Please view the template help TDMDownloads module to see how it is constructed.
