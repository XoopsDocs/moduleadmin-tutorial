# 5.0 The help section of the module



To create a Help section we added in xoops_version.php : 

```$modversion['help'] = 'page=help'; ```

This instruction automatically enables a help button in the navigation tab of the module's administration :

Also, it enables to create a Menu in the Admin Index page :

The help template exists is in the language file so it can be translated for each language. 
The structure is as follows: 

    modulename 
        L language 
            L english 
                L help 
                    L help.html 

Please view the template help TDMDownloads module to see how it is constructed.
