# Installation

The ModuleAdmin Framework is part of XOOPS Core since XOOPS 2.5.4, so currently there is no need to install it separately.

For a module to take advantage of the ModuleAdmin Framework, you only have to set "system\_mune" to "1" in the xoops\_version.php:

`$modversion['system_menu'] = 1;`
